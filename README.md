# Jewelry E-Commerce Page

This project serves as a static demonstration page for an e-commerce site focused on jewelry. Created as part of a coding bootcamp assignment, the primary goal was to practice and implement CSS Grid for layout design, effectively simulating the structure of an online store.

## Components
- **Header**: Displays the name of the store.  
- **Main Section**:  
  - **Products**: Jewelry items are displayed in the center/right side of the page, showcasing images and brief descriptions.  
  - **Categories Column**: Located on the left, it contains links to various jewelry categories (e.g., necklaces, rings, bracelets).  
- **Footer**: The final section contains links to the imprint, privacy policy, and other relevant resources.
